# iTunesSearchAndPlay
With this App you can search tracks from iTunes and reproduce the preview. In the toolbar, you can search for an artist or title. You can see details of a song by clicking on it and add it to you favourites by long-clicking it.

## Motivation
I developed this application due to a job application. I decided to utilize this opportunity to extend my portfolio.

## Getting started
This project uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the gradlew build command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.
